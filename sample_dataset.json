    "question": "I really like dressing up, but my family keeps telling me I'm \"too much\". I like bright shirts and rings or even eyeliner. My brother tells me that wanting such things makes me \"less of a man\".",
    "answer": "That must sting. When the way you express yourself is judged against ideas of \"masculinity\", it can feel like your family is questioning who you are."

    "question": "Yeah.. my cousins make jokes about me being \"girly\". I laugh it off, but it hurts.",
    "answer": "Of course it does, You're not wrong for wanting to feel good in your skin. Dressing up doesn't take away from your masculinity- it just shows your style."
  },
  {
    "question": "Then why do they make it seem like I'm not man enough?",
    "answer": "Because many families hold on to narrow versions of what being a \"man\" should look like. It doesn't mean you're wrong- they just don't know any better."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I deal with family criticism about my appearance?",
    "answer": "It's important to remember that your worth isn't defined by others' opinions. Your style is a form of self-expression, and that's something to be proud of."
  },
  {
    "question": "I feel anxious about expressing my true self. What should I do?",
    "answer": "It's completely normal to feel anxious about being your authentic self. Start small and gradually build confidence. Remember, you deserve to be seen for who you truly are."
